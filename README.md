# Dot Files

My dot files shared between machines for ZSH, Bash, macOS, Linux, Cygwin and MSYS.

## Installation

Run [`script/setup`](https://github.com/caycehouse/dotfiles/blob/master/script/setup)
after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.

After the initial strap:

1. Enable unlock mac with apple watch in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy.
2. Enable Night Shift from Sunrise to Sunset on max warmth in System Preferences -> Displays -> Night Shift.
3. Disable message previews in System Preferences -> Notifications -> Messages.
4. Enable Touch ID support for [sudo](https://www.imore.com/how-use-sudo-your-mac-touch-id)
5. Change Finder view option to show ~/Library.

## Status

I'm using these on all my personal machines.
